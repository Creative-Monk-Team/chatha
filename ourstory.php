          At the time of our inception, we had one main aim in our minds: producing premium quality processed meat products, using cutting-edge technology, with no room for compromise. And owing to this belief, with which  <strong> we started in 1997, we are presently one of India’s leading frozen and ready-to-eat processed meat products manufacturers.</strong>

        <!--    And now we have forayed into the processed & frozen vegetarian product market, namely snacks, bakery, breads, curries and more, in an absolutely separate and new vegetarian production facility with the same values, beliefs and aim with which we started.-->

          	<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
          	<div>We began our journey in 1998. At that time, frozen foods had already entered the Indian market. However, the healthiness of these, especially that of processed meat, was often questioned in most Indian households. We saw these doubts as a challenge, and prior to any other plans, drafted a firm resolve; producing premium quality processed meat products with no room for compromise.</div>

          	<h2>Modern Machinery</h2>
          	<div>All our further steps reflected our mantra. We brought in raw material only from the approved suppliers. Next, the most hygienic and hi-tech machinery was imported, and our plant was born. Batch after batch, we only got better. The plant that generated only a few chicken products at the time of its initiation, over time, evolved into one producing around 70-80 premium meat products. </div>

          	<h2>Customer Centricity</h2>
          	<div>Apart from quality assurance, developing strong customer relationships, through a partnership approach, has always been a top priority for us. And consequently, today, we are associated with various international food chains as well as several local QSRs. We were operational from 1998 (post incorporation in 1997) and owing to the aim and principles with which we had started, we soon transformed ourselves into a recognized and trusted brand name in the field. And the rest, as they say, is history. </div>

                    Our initial days of strenuous struggle still visit me in dramatic flashbacks. Indulged in a reverie of those rough tides, I am comforted by the sailors who got us through it all, my team. Hours of hard work, a grave determination, and a never-say-die attitude helped us march forward. It is because of those efforts that, today, we stand proud in our efficiently managed plant, producing 70-80 processed meat products of the most premium quality in the market. Where, on one hand, research and development as well as product engineering continue to be our tools of innovation, consistent quality control and greater efficiency provide an unparalleled stability to all our operations, day after day. Presently, we are ranked as one of the most sought-after processed meat products manufacturers in the country. And for this, I thank my team from the bottom of my heart.
